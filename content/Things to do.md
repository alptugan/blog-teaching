# Battery Calibration

All newly-installed smart batteries should be calibrated as soon as possible. This helps your system get an accurate reading on the battery’s state of charge. Without calibration, the battery percentage reading will be incorrect, and your device may behave oddly—shutting down suddenly even though the new battery “reads” half charged, or working for hours when the battery reads nearly dead.

For **phones**, **tablets** and **smartwatches**:

1. Charge it to 100% and keep charging it for at least 2 more hours.
2. Use your device until it shuts off due to low battery.
3. Charge it uninterrupted to 100%.

For **laptops**:

1. Charge it to 100%, and keep charging it for at least two more hours.
2. Unplug your laptop and use it normally to drain the battery.
3. Save your work when you see the low battery warning.
4. Keep your laptop on until it goes to sleep due to low battery.
5. Wait at least five hours, then charge your laptop uninterrupted to 100%.

It is recommended to perform this process periodically to ensure that the battery remains properly calibrated throughout its lifespan.
