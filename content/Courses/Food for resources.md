## üì∫ Movies & Documentations
[MAKING WAVES (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3856408/) The new documentary ‚ÄúMaking Waves‚Äù explores the art of movie sound design. Here are 23 classic films, which were discussed in the documentary, that pushed the boundaries of movie sound.

[King Kong (1993)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/fullcredits/) Murray Spivack pioneered sound design by creating his own effects for the movie. Spivack went to the zoo to record animals, which he then slowed down to get the roar of Kong.

[Citizen Kane (1941)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/) Orson Welles brought to Hollywood some of the innovation of his radio plays. Giving each space it‚Äôs own sound, reverberation, sense of depth and point of view. He was energizing the image with sound to tell a story.

[The Birds (1963)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/) Hitchcock incorporated sound into the concept of the script, using it to control the audience‚Äôs experience. With ‚ÄúThe Birds,‚Äù Hitch didn‚Äôt use one of his big, psychological Bernard Herrmann scores, but he worked with Herrmann on the sound of the birds to create a rhythmic, eerie diagetic soundscape.

[Spartacus (1960)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054331/) In a big battle scene the soldiers‚Äô armour sounded like tin pots. Jack Foley saved an expensive reshoot showing he could recreate the proper sound with his keys and add the sound later in post-production. Since the terms "Foley Effects, Foley Artist, Foley Sound" were not in the literature and sound, Jack Foley's name was left uncredited. Such a shame!

[Funny Girl (1968)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062994/) Barbra Streisand convinced director William Wyler to let her sing songs live while filming, rather than lip sync to a pre-recorded track. 
>One of the very first attempts to make lip synching...

[The Godfather (1972)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/) As Michael (Pacino) braces himself for the murder that will end his dream of breaking from the family business, sound designer Walter Murch put unmotivated, screeching elevated subway train noises on the soundtrack, which speak to Michael‚Äôs mental state: It‚Äôs the sound of ‚Äúhis neurons clashing against each other.‚Äù Murch had been doing work like this on small, oddball films like ‚ÄúTHX 1138,‚Äù but with this scene he realized it was also possible to do on Hollywood studio films.

[A Star Is Born (1976)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075265/) A decade after music LPs had adopted stereo, Barbra Streisand used her power in the film world to insist her film be mixed and presented in stereo sound, playing the key role in moving theaters out of the mono world.
> The use of stereo sound in cinema...

[Star Wars (1977)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/) Sound Designer Ben Burtt spent a year collecting sound and experimenting trying to figure out how to bring Chewbacca, R2-D2, lightsabers, and a sense of grand space warfare to life in a way that made George Lucas‚Äô special effects sci-fi fantasy seem real.

[Eraserhead (1977)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/) David Lynch and sound designer Alan Splet used abstract sound not motivated by what is seen on screen to create a powerful soundscape.

[Apocalypse Now (1979)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/)Walter Murch‚Äôs work on Coppola‚Äôs ‚ÄúApocalypse Now‚Äù changed how sound was edited and mixed for film forever. Right from the opening sequence, Murch built a soundscape that forced the audience to experience the film through Captain Willard‚Äôs warped and war-weary point-of-view. By the mid-‚Äô70s, theaters had only just started to transition from mono to stereo sound, but Coppola wanted his Vietnam War film to push both theaters and Hollywood at large towards a six-speaker surround system. No one had ever mixed film sound to travel around a movie theater. Not only did Murch pioneer the process, which still to this day is the foundation of most sound mixes, he artistically did it better than anyone has done it since.
> One of the very first surround sound system setup...

[Nashville (1975)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073440/) Production sound mixer Jim Webb and director Robert Altman in the 1970s pioneered multi-track sound recording, putting mics on virtually every actor in frame.
> The first multi-track sound recording...

[Luxo Jr (1986)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091455/) One of the enormous and rarely discussed keys to Pixar‚Äôs success has been the pioneering work of Gary Rydstrom. Similar to what his mentor Burtt did in ‚ÄúStar Wars,‚Äù Rydstrom had to create sounds that brought to life these new digital creations. Sound effects that embodied the objects themselves, that gave them identifable weight and texture, but also anthropomorphizes them. It‚Äôs work that started with Pixar‚Äôs first short, ‚ÄúLuxo Jr,‚Äù with the sounds Rydstrom created for the springing lamp‚Äôs movement and ability to communicate. It‚Äôs remarkable to see how much of the sound mastery of ‚ÄúWall-E‚Äù was presented two decades earlier in this lamp.

[Jurassic Park (1993)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/) Spielberg said the first time he heard Gary Rydstrom‚Äôs T-Rex roar it literally knocked him out of his chair. It‚Äôs a sound so overpowering and fierce, and yet real. In imagining what dinosaurs really sounded like, Rydstrom also created effects that gave the poineering action VFX-driven film its needed heft.

[Saving Private Ryan (1998)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/) The D-Day battle scene was done without a John Williams score, as sound was used to tell the story and show that the action continued outside the frame. [Doom Day Landing Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_cCSWBo4cA)

[Ordinary People (1980)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081283/) A film that uses silence to show the disconnect between people, sound editors Kay Rose and Victoria Rose Sampson fixed horrible production sound in the key psychologist scenes (recorded in an aluminum warehouse) and created the intimate silence director Robert Redford needed.
> The use of silence...

[A League of Their Own (1992)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104694/) In ‚ÄúMaking Waves,‚Äù Bobbi Banks‚Äô work on the ‚Äúno crying in baseball scene‚Äù is used as an example of great ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement), as she recreated the whole scene in post to give it the needed cadence and tone.
> ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement): Automated dialogue replacement refers to the process of re-recording audio in a more controlled and quieter setting. Usually captured in a postproduction studio, ADR is a way to improve audio quality or reflect changes in dialogue and performance. The early days of audio replacement ADR‚Äîalso known as ‚Äúlooping‚Äù‚Äîinvolved looping a length of film over and over to allow the actor to perfectly match and sync their performance from set. Today, the actual ‚Äúlooping‚Äù happens on a computer, which is where the ‚Äúautomated‚Äù part of ADR comes in. But it‚Äôs still up to the actor to deliver their performance. If nearby noise interrupts or drowns out your filmed dialogue, it‚Äôll have to be recaptured in the ADR process. 
> 
> Peter Jackson‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù trilogy involved heavy ADR, largely because filming took place next to an airport. ‚ÄúA lot of the time we would stop and wait until the plane flew over that particular studio. But ‚ÄòThe Lord of the Rings‚Äô was such a big production that, often, time was money and it became a money equation,‚Äù

[The Matrix (1999)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/) For a film about a digital reality, sound designer Dane Davis attempted to make the first soundscape entirely in a digital post-production sound work station.¬† Cutting and creating sounds in an digital environment wasn‚Äôt just a technical experiment, it was key to how Davis made the film‚Äôs virtual world of ones and zeros come to life. Transitions between dimensions sounded jagged, almost computer generated, rather than the dreamy flashbacks or cosmic crossovers we were used to in movies.
> The sound design process was handled completely in a digital post-production stage.

[Argo (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/) Sound designer Erik Aadahl recreates the powerful scene of revolutionary protests with 100 Farsi-speaking sound extras. 
> Plot: Acting under the cover of a Hollywood producer scouting a location for a science fiction film, a CIA agent launches a dangerous operation to rescue six Americans in Tehran during the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran in 1979.
[Protests Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j4k-10bZC0)

[Brokeback Mountain (2005)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/) Next time you watch ‚ÄúBrokeback Mountain‚Äù pay attention to how director Ang Lee and supervising sound editor Eugene Gearty tell the story with their use of wind. Each piece of wind sound speaks to the shifting emotional states of isolated characters who bury their emotions deep inside.
> The use of nature sounds to tell emotional aspects of communication.

[Selma (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020072/) One of the challenges in historical films is making events from the past feel immediate and relatable. The visceral, real sound of people running for their lives on the bridge in ‚ÄúSelma‚Äù is a textbook example of how sound can help accomplish this. The movement, the emotions, the violence rushes through the frame, sound grabbing the audience‚Äôs attention in a way that feels nothing like the distant past.

[Lost in Translation (2003)]() Sofia Coppola‚Äôs film is a great example of how layers of well-chosen ==ambient sounds== can create an atmosphere that brings the story world to life.

[Top Gun (1986)]() Supervising sound editor Cece Hall adds the sound of animal roars to the sound of real jet engines to create dynamic scenes of the air force.
> The use of animal sounds mimicking mechanical sounds happened before in Star Wars Xwing spaceship sounds...

[Roma (2018)]() Alfonso Cuar√≥n‚Äôs use of layers and sound movement, through a ==Dolby Atmos== mix, is the latest breakthrough in sound design.

[Gravity (2013)]() Gravity redefined the traditional approach to sound in space. Knowing that sound doesn't travel in a vacuum, the audio team, led by Glenn Freemantle, was challenged with the task of creating aural effects that matched the eye-popping nature of the film‚Äôs visuals. So, the team chose to convey sound through the characters' suits, using vibrations. This inventive solution created an intimate, terrifying, and yet strangely silent world, proving that sometimes, the absence of sound can be as powerful as its presence.

[A Quiet Place (2018)]() Another example of a film that shows the influence the absence of sound can have is A Quiet Place, featured here. The strategic lack of sound is, really, the heart of of the movie, a horror film where the slightest noise attracts the human-slaying monsters roaming around outside. With a minimalistic approach, the sound design significantly heightens tension and fear, transforming silence into a menacing character itself. This is an excellent demonstration of how less can be more in sound design, and a testament to the power of sound in driving narrative and emotion.

Blade Runner (1982) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017)
A double bill of both Blade Runner films offers a course in how sound can be used to construct a believable and engrossing universe. Vangelis' synthesizer-driven score in the original movie creates an eerie, futuristic atmosphere that's integral to the film's dystopian appeal. The sequel echoes and elaborates on these audio themes with Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer's electronic-based score, immersing viewers in a desolate yet familiar soundscape.

The Conversation (1974)
Walter Murch's work on Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation offers a masterclass in audio storytelling. The plot revolves around a surveillance expert and a particular conversation he's trying to interpret, immediately integrating the importance of audio into the story‚Äôs larger narrative. The way audio clues are laid out for both the protagonist and the audience during the course of the film highlights the ability for these audio clips to be a central narrative device.

The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001-2003)
The Lord of the Rings trilogy demonstrates the grandeur that sound can add to an epic fairytale. Howard Shore's sweeping score is as integral to Middle-earth as its stunning visuals; similar to Burtt‚Äôs influence on the Star Wars franchise. From the quiet, calming rustling of leaves in the Shire to the horrifying screeches of the Nazgul, and the stomps of the troll‚Äôs feet, the detailed and diverse sound design by Ethan Van der Ryn and Mike Hopkins brings the fantasy world to life. We can only imagine how much fun this project was for the audio engineers‚Äîafter all, how do you begin to fathom what a Nazgul would sound like anyway?

No Country for Old Men (2007)
No Country For Old Men sparsely uses music, and instead relies heavily on sound design to build tension, specifically the use of diegetic sound‚Äîsound (in an television show, movie, etc.) that occurs within the context of the story and is able to be heard by the characters. It‚Äôs sounds like the hiss of Anton Chigurh's captive bolt pistol that show the effect Sound Editor Skip Lievasay wanted to achieve in this thriller. The absence of non-diegetic sound, or sound that serves only the audience and not the characters in the story, can offer a powerful narrative purpose.

Dunkirk (2017)
Christopher Nolan's war epic Dunkirk uses sound to a nerve-wracking effect. From the ticking clock that underscores the entire score to the deafening roars of planes and explosions, the soundscape created by Richard King and Alex Gibson is relentless, anxiety-inducing, and incredibly effective at placing the audience right in the middle of the chaos.

Baby Driver (2017)
Baby Driver stands out because it lets the music shine. The orchestration of music and movement in this movie had to be perfect‚Äîthe story is about a badass getaway-car driver, after all‚Äîand the designers nail it. Between the song choices that really pump up the vibe of the movie and the high-octane chase scenes and action-packed visuals, there‚Äôs a dance happening between the movie‚Äôs two elements, always adding to the energy-packed feeling of the film.

Dreamgirls (2006)
Dreamgirls won an Oscar for Sound Mixing back in 2007, and for good reason. The film follows a fictional storyline that closely echoes the history of Motown through the 1960s and 1970s, which means it‚Äôs brimming with memorable music performances. In a movie where the vocal and musical performances are equally important as the dialogue, the mixing had to be fine-tuned to bring out the best from both sides of the narrative, the actual Motown singing and the storyline. Encapsulating the essence of an era where melodies spoke volumes, the mixing in Dreamgirls a shining example of how the art of sound can truly elevate a narrative.

Gladiator (2000)
In Gladiator, a visceral version of Roman history is portrayed on-camera, and the movie‚Äôs sound designers had a monumental task during its creation. The roar of the spectators echoing through the enormity of the Colosseum. The screams of a fighter on his final breath. The clashing of swords, axes, and shields. The sound design in Gladiator is instrumental in transporting its audience deep into the fierce realities of the Roman Colosseum. The audio landscape provides a visceral depth to this epic tale, anchoring viewers firmly within its action-filled universe.

The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)
The Bourne Ultimatum, another Oscar-winning movie in the Sound Mixing category, expertly wields its sound design as a tool of immersion into the action-packed world of Jason Bourne. The mixing here allows the audience to really feel each punch and hear every tire screech, and while you might not notice that upon the first time watching the movie, you‚Äôll certainly hear the difference it makes when you watch it next. The audio elevates the film's relentless pace, but also tunes viewers into its nuances, like the clanking of a keychain or footsteps from down the hall. Overall, it provides an exciting sonic journey alongside one of the world‚Äôs finest fictional spies.

The Hurt Locker (2008)
The Hurt Locker, a war thriller that follows a bomb-diffusion team through war-torn Afghanistan, is infused with boiling-point tension and incredible use of sound design. The experts behind the mixing board on this movie use sound to help characterize the scenery‚Äîmilitary-style sounds play during scenes at the U.S. Army Base in contrast to notably ‚Äúthird world‚Äù sounds that play during scenes shot out in the city of Baghdad; when it‚Äôs time for one character to diffuse a bomb, the clicking and ticking sound as if they are happening right in your ear, bringing the audience one-step closer to the character‚Äôs experience. All in all, the sounds of The Hurt Locker are a pivotal aspect to the film and cannot go under-appreciated.

Hacksaw Ridge (2016)
Any war movie requires a particular attention to sound. Hacksaw Ridge, the story of the battle of Okinawa, displays one of the bloodiest battles in World War II with a remarkable commitment to auditory detail. Every single audio clip in this movie was meticulously crafted or replaced, a tactic that allows the sound designers to fine-tune the audience‚Äôs experience of the war drama. From the resounding explosions of the battle scenes to the hushed whispers of prayer, the completely customized sound design augments the gritty realism of this heavy-hitting real story.

Whiplash (2014)
Whiplash is a testament to the power of jazz. As is expected, the film needed to make its audio more than a mere backdrop‚Äîrather, the score and sound design of this film are truly its heartbeat. The film opens with the sound of a drum roll, getting faster and faster, and it just builds in tone (and tempo) from there. Intense dialogue instills an aggressive tone to the film, which is matched beat-for-beat by the movie‚Äôs complex musical score. If you‚Äôre looking for a musically inspired movie that‚Äôll leave your jaw on the floor, look no further.

Spencer (2021)
Spencer comes with a surprise twist: The composer of the movie‚Äôs score is Johnny Greenwood, better known as the guitar player in the band Radiohead. Over the course of his career, he‚Äôs made a quiet name for himself as a movie score composer and, here, blends jazz and classic, Baroque styles to create an ominous overtone to the film. Greenwood uses sound design to portray the protagonist's internal struggle, employing subtlety to powerful effect. The echo of the empty palace, the rustle of turning pages, all contribute to a sense of isolation and unrest. Here, the audio is more than an accompaniment‚Äîit's a nuanced character in the story.

Inception
What do dreams sound like? That's the question that Christopher Nolan and his sound design team set out to answer, and quite successfully. Inception is filled with sounds that are both real and surreal and help immerse the viewer in the bizarre dreamscape that its characters must escape from.

Wall-E
How do you tell a story when your main characters can‚Äôt speak? In the case of Wall-E, quite masterfully. Every beep, squeak, and creak in Wall-E helps paint an emotional picture of a lonely little robot searching for some beauty in a world gone wrong, proving that when you have great sound, you don‚Äôt always need words.

Braveheart
Braveheart beautifully captures not only the serene landscape of the Scottish highlands, but the brutality of an oppressive regime and the war waged to be free from it. From the beautiful echoes of bagpipes to the rallying war cries of a scrappy army, Braveheart rings in your ears long after the final shot fades.

Apollo 13
Similar to Gravity, Apollo 13 seeks to put the audience in the passenger seat of a daring space mission. Unlike Gravity, however, the sound design of Apollo 13 is less minimal but still impactful. It focuses heavily on the music of the era to tell the story of astronauts that are desperate to find a way back home.

‚ÄçThe Black Stallion
Like Wall-E, The Black Stallion decides to forego dialogue almost completely to tell the story of a shipwrecked boy and the huge black horse that saves his life and becomes his companion. Instead, director Carroll Ballard relies on a highly detailed sound environment and swelling soundtrack to set the stage for an incredible story of survival and friendship between a boy and his horse.

Fiddler on the Roof
While Fiddler on the Roof is far older than many of the movies on this list, it is still a phenomenal example of cutting-edge sound design for the time. Using the highest quality recording devices available, Fiddler on the Roof expertly captures every lilt of the violin and builds a stunning soundscape over this film shot largely on silent soundstages.

300
What makes the sound design in 300 so impressive is that nearly every sound element of this film had to be artificially created. Filmed almost entirely in a CGI-ready void, 300 does not benefit from natural environmental sounds that can be used in the final mix. Instead, sound designers inserted nearly every element of the final product, from the clanging of shields to the rustling of a breeze.

West Side Story
Like Fiddler on the Roof, West Side Story is a musical that used the leading sound capturing and designing technology of the time to create the crystal-clear soundtrack of this modern Romeo and Juliet masterpiece.

Amadeus
You simply cannot tell the story of one of the greatest composers of all time without a soundscape to match it. And Amadeus pulls out all the stops to have sound design worthy of the master himself, crafting a resonant soundtrack over a beautifully designed natural soundscape of 1800's Vienna.

There is a reason many Best Picture winners also take home awards for Best Sound Design or Best Sound Mixing. Sound is one of the crucial elements that goes into making a film that people will remember, and these movies leave a lasting impression on both our eyes and our ears for years to come.
