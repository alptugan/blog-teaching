[Myron Krueger - Videoplace, Responsive Environment (1986)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmmxVA5xhuo) Documentation produced 1988, Museum of Natural History, Vernon; The participant's image is digitized to create silhouettes which is analyzed by specialized processors. The processors analyze the image's posture, rate of movement, and its relationship to other graphic objects in the system. They then react to the movement of the participant and create a series of responses-be they visual or auditory reactions. Two or more environments could also be linked. A series of simulations is programmed based on any action and Videoplace offered over 50 compositions and interactions (including Critter, Individual Medley, Fractal, Finger Painting, Digital Drawing, Body Surfacing, Replay, among others). To illustrate, when the participant's silhouette pushed a graphic object-the computer choose to move the object or the silhouette. Or, as in Finger Painting where each finger created flowing paint without the distraction of the silhouette. Myron Krueger is one of the original pioneers of virtual reality and interactive art. Beginning in 1969, Krueger developed the prototypes for what would eventually be called Virtual Reality. More info: [http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/]

[‚ÄúPut-that-there‚Äù:¬†Voice and gesture at the graphics interface](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/965105.807503)The work described herein involves the user commanding simple shapes about a large-screen graphics display surface. Because voice can be augmented with simultaneous pointing, the free usage of pronouns becomes possible, with a corresponding gain in naturalness and economy of expression. Conversely, gesture aided by voice gains precision in its power to reference. [video](https://x.com/ipoupyrev/status/1825578546808676370)
