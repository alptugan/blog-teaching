[The Magic of Making Sound (Foley Recording)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO3N_PRIgX0)
In Hollywood, everything is magic and make-believe, even sounds. When you watch a film that immerses you completely in its world, you’re probably hearing the work of sound artists. If the work is done right, you won’t be able to tell that the “natural” sounds on screen are manufactured with studio props. That's the challenge for Warner Bros. Foley artists Alyson Moore, Chris Moriana and mixer Mary Jo Lang. Theirs is a practice in recreation, one creative element at a time.

## 🎬 Movies
[M (Fritz Lang, 1931)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022100/)
Most historians have recalled the first years of sound in cinema as slow. Many of the first films didn’t know how to use this new tool and filled the screen with endless dialogue. Many films started to look like recorded plays, and much of the language started to take a step back. Sound had many critics in its first steps, including the famous resistance of Charlie Chaplin to use it in “Modern Times” (1936). That is the reason why “M” can be seen as a film of the future.
Jacques Rivette said about “Viaggio in Italia” (Roberto Rosselini, 1954): “When Viaggio in Italia came out, the rest of the films aged 10 years,” and the same could be applied to “M”. But what it makes “M” a lesson about sound design? The great discovery made by Lang was silence. The thing the first sound films failed to see was that with sound silence came as well, and it is inside that game where sound can be a masterful tool.
The unsettling whistling of the killer in the film works because it enters in an almost empty background. You can hear Peter Lorre’s whistling, his steps, and the mumblings of the kids in total silence. With that game set, every time we hear the song we know danger is near.

[Citizen Kane (1941)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/) Orson Welles brought to Hollywood some of the innovation of his radio plays. Giving each space it’s own sound, reverberation, sense of depth and point of view. He was energizing the image with sound to tell a story.

[The Birds (1963)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/) Hitchcock incorporated sound into the concept of the script, using it to control the audience’s experience. With “The Birds,” Hitch didn’t use one of his big, psychological Bernard Herrmann scores, but he worked with Herrmann on the sound of the birds to create a rhythmic, eerie diagetic soundscape.

[Spartacus (1960)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054331/) In a big battle scene the soldiers’ armour sounded like tin pots. Jack Foley saved an expensive reshoot showing he could recreate the proper sound with his keys and add the sound later in post-production. Since the terms "Foley Effects, Foley Artist, Foley Sound" were not in the literature and sound, Jack Foley's name was left uncredited. Such a shame!

[Funny Girl (1968)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062994/) Barbra Streisand convinced director William Wyler to let her sing songs live while filming, rather than lip sync to a pre-recorded track. 
>One of the very first attempts to make lip synching...

[Fiddler on the Roof (1971)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067093/)
While Fiddler on the Roof is far older than many of the movies on this list, it is still a phenomenal example of cutting-edge sound design for the time. Using the highest quality recording devices available, Fiddler on the Roof expertly captures every lilt of the violin and builds a stunning soundscape over this film shot largely on silent soundstages.

[The Godfather (1972)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/) As Michael (Pacino) braces himself for the murder that will end his dream of breaking from the family business, sound designer Walter Murch put unmotivated, screeching elevated subway train noises on the soundtrack, which speak to Michael’s mental state: It’s the sound of “his neurons clashing against each other.” Murch had been doing work like this on small, oddball films like “THX 1138,” but with this scene he realized it was also possible to do on Hollywood studio films.

[The Conversation (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/)
Walter Murch's work on Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation offers a masterclass in audio storytelling. The plot revolves around a surveillance expert and a particular conversation he's trying to interpret, immediately integrating the importance of audio into the story’s larger narrative. The way audio clues are laid out for both the protagonist and the audience during the course of the film highlights the ability for these audio clips to be a central narrative device. “The Conversation” can be probably named as the film with the biggest auto-reflection on sound use. Gene Hackman plays a paranoid spy recording a couple, and in the sound room he finds out that the couple will be murdered. Aside from the thriller elements, the film works as a big metaphor on sound and private/public spaces. Hackman records the couple in their intimacy walking around a park, and at the same time is totally frightened by the idea of someone interrupting his intimacy.
As we can see in his work on sound editing, we start to think about this work applied in the film we are seeing. Immediately we think that the audience is indeed spying on Hackman. “The Conversation” reveals sound devices and strips technical aspects of cinema like in “Blow Out”, but without directly talking about film. However, the work is the same, using manipulation, control and spying. This film is one of Coppola’s best.

[Nashville (1975)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073440/) Production sound mixer Jim Webb and director Robert Altman in the 1970s pioneered multi-track sound recording, putting mics on virtually every actor in frame.
> The first multi-track sound recording...

[A Star Is Born (1976)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075265/) A decade after music LPs had adopted stereo, Barbra Streisand used her power in the film world to insist her film be mixed and presented in stereo sound, playing the key role in moving theaters out of the mono world.
> The use of stereo sound in cinema...

[Star Wars (1977)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/) Sound Designer Ben Burtt spent a year collecting sound and experimenting trying to figure out how to bring Chewbacca, R2-D2, lightsabers, and a sense of grand space warfare to life in a way that made George Lucas’ special effects sci-fi fantasy seem real.

[Eraserhead (1977)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/) David Lynch and sound designer Alan Splet used abstract sound not motivated by what is seen on screen to create a powerful soundscape.

[‍The Black Stallion (1979)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078872/)
Like Wall-E, The Black Stallion decides to forego dialogue almost completely to tell the story of a shipwrecked boy and the huge black horse that saves his life and becomes his companion. Instead, director Carroll Ballard relies on a highly detailed sound environment and swelling soundtrack to set the stage for an incredible story of survival and friendship between a boy and his horse.

[Apocalypse Now (1979)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/)Walter Murch’s work on Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now” changed how sound was edited and mixed for film forever. Right from the opening sequence, Murch built a soundscape that forced the audience to experience the film through Captain Willard’s warped and war-weary point-of-view. By the mid-’70s, theaters had only just started to transition from mono to stereo sound, but Coppola wanted his Vietnam War film to push both theaters and Hollywood at large towards a six-speaker surround system. No one had ever mixed film sound to travel around a movie theater. Not only did Murch pioneer the process, which still to this day is the foundation of most sound mixes, he artistically did it better than anyone has done it since.
> One of the very first surround sound system setup...

[Luxo Jr (1986)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091455/) One of the enormous and rarely discussed keys to Pixar’s success has been the pioneering work of Gary Rydstrom. Similar to what his mentor Burtt did in “Star Wars,” Rydstrom had to create sounds that brought to life these new digital creations. Sound effects that embodied the objects themselves, that gave them identifable weight and texture, but also anthropomorphizes them. It’s work that started with Pixar’s first short, “Luxo Jr,” with the sounds Rydstrom created for the springing lamp’s movement and ability to communicate. It’s remarkable to see how much of the sound mastery of “Wall-E” was presented two decades earlier in this lamp.

[Jurassic Park (1993)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/) Spielberg said the first time he heard Gary Rydstrom’s T-Rex roar it literally knocked him out of his chair. It’s a sound so overpowering and fierce, and yet real. In imagining what dinosaurs really sounded like, Rydstrom also created effects that gave the poineering action VFX-driven film its needed heft.

[King Kong (1993)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/fullcredits/) Murray Spivack pioneered sound design by creating his own effects for the movie. Spivack went to the zoo to record animals, which he then slowed down to get the roar of Kong.

[Saving Private Ryan (1998)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/) The D-Day battle scene was done without a John Williams score, as sound was used to tell the story and show that the action continued outside the frame. [Doom Day Landing Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_cCSWBo4cA)

[Ordinary People (1980)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081283/) A film that uses silence to show the disconnect between people, sound editors Kay Rose and Victoria Rose Sampson fixed horrible production sound in the key psychologist scenes (recorded in an aluminum warehouse) and created the intimate silence director Robert Redford needed.
> The use of silence...

[A League of Their Own (1992)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104694/) In “Making Waves,” Bobbi Banks’ work on the “no crying in baseball scene” is used as an example of great ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement), as she recreated the whole scene in post to give it the needed cadence and tone.
> ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement): Automated dialogue replacement refers to the process of re-recording audio in a more controlled and quieter setting. Usually captured in a postproduction studio, ADR is a way to improve audio quality or reflect changes in dialogue and performance. The early days of audio replacement ADR—also known as “looping”—involved looping a length of film over and over to allow the actor to perfectly match and sync their performance from set. Today, the actual “looping” happens on a computer, which is where the “automated” part of ADR comes in. But it’s still up to the actor to deliver their performance. If nearby noise interrupts or drowns out your filmed dialogue, it’ll have to be recaptured in the ADR process. 
> 
> Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy involved heavy ADR, largely because filming took place next to an airport. “A lot of the time we would stop and wait until the plane flew over that particular studio. But ‘The Lord of the Rings’ was such a big production that, often, time was money and it became a money equation,”

[The Matrix (1999)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/) For a film about a digital reality, sound designer Dane Davis attempted to make the first soundscape entirely in a digital post-production sound work station.  Cutting and creating sounds in an digital environment wasn’t just a technical experiment, it was key to how Davis made the film’s virtual world of ones and zeros come to life. Transitions between dimensions sounded jagged, almost computer generated, rather than the dreamy flashbacks or cosmic crossovers we were used to in movies.
> The sound design process was handled completely in a digital post-production stage.

[Argo (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/) Sound designer Erik Aadahl recreates the powerful scene of revolutionary protests with 100 Farsi-speaking sound extras. 
> Plot: Acting under the cover of a Hollywood producer scouting a location for a science fiction film, a CIA agent launches a dangerous operation to rescue six Americans in Tehran during the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran in 1979.
[Protests Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j4k-10bZC0)

[Brokeback Mountain (2005)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/) Next time you watch “Brokeback Mountain” pay attention to how director Ang Lee and supervising sound editor Eugene Gearty tell the story with their use of wind. Each piece of wind sound speaks to the shifting emotional states of isolated characters who bury their emotions deep inside.
> The use of nature sounds to tell emotional aspects of communication.

[Selma (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020072/) One of the challenges in historical films is making events from the past feel immediate and relatable. The visceral, real sound of people running for their lives on the bridge in “Selma” is a textbook example of how sound can help accomplish this. The movement, the emotions, the violence rushes through the frame, sound grabbing the audience’s attention in a way that feels nothing like the distant past.

[Lost in Translation (2003)]() Sofia Coppola’s film is a great example of how layers of well-chosen ==ambient sounds== can create an atmosphere that brings the story world to life.

[Top Gun (1986)]() Supervising sound editor Cece Hall adds the sound of animal roars to the sound of real jet engines to create dynamic scenes of the air force.
> The use of animal sounds mimicking mechanical sounds happened before in Star Wars Xwing spaceship sounds...

[Roma (2018)]() Alfonso Cuarón’s use of layers and sound movement, through a ==Dolby Atmos== mix, is the latest breakthrough in sound design.

[Gravity (2013)]() Gravity redefined the traditional approach to sound in space. Knowing that sound doesn't travel in a vacuum, the audio team, led by Glenn Freemantle, was challenged with the task of creating aural effects that matched the eye-popping nature of the film’s visuals. So, the team chose to convey sound through the characters' suits, using vibrations. This inventive solution created an intimate, terrifying, and yet strangely silent world, proving that sometimes, the absence of sound can be as powerful as its presence.

[A Quiet Place (2018)]() Another example of a film that shows the influence the absence of sound can have is A Quiet Place, featured here. The strategic lack of sound is, really, the heart of of the movie, a horror film where the slightest noise attracts the human-slaying monsters roaming around outside. With a minimalistic approach, the sound design significantly heightens tension and fear, transforming silence into a menacing character itself. This is an excellent demonstration of how less can be more in sound design, and a testament to the power of sound in driving narrative and emotion.

[Blade Runner (1982)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/) and [Blade Runner 2049 (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/)
A double bill of both Blade Runner films offers a course in how sound can be used to construct a believable and engrossing universe. Vangelis' synthesizer-driven score in the original movie creates an eerie, futuristic atmosphere that's integral to the film's dystopian appeal. The sequel echoes and elaborates on these audio themes with Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer's electronic-based score, immersing viewers in a desolate yet familiar soundscape.

[The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001-2003)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/)
The Lord of the Rings trilogy demonstrates the grandeur that sound can add to an epic fairytale. Howard Shore's sweeping score is as integral to Middle-earth as its stunning visuals; similar to Burtt’s influence on the Star Wars franchise. From the quiet, calming rustling of leaves in the Shire to the horrifying screeches of the Nazgul, and the stomps of the troll’s feet, the detailed and diverse sound design by Ethan Van der Ryn and Mike Hopkins brings the fantasy world to life. We can only imagine how much fun this project was for the audio engineers—after all, how do you begin to fathom what a Nazgul would sound like anyway?

[Dreamgirls (2006)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443489/)
Dreamgirls won an Oscar for Sound Mixing back in 2006, and for good reason. The film follows a fictional storyline that closely echoes the history of Motown through the 1960s and 1970s, which means it’s brimming with memorable music performances. In a movie where the vocal and musical performances are equally important as the dialogue, the mixing had to be fine-tuned to bring out the best from both sides of the narrative, the actual Motown singing and the storyline. Encapsulating the essence of an era where melodies spoke volumes, the mixing in Dreamgirls a shining example of how the art of sound can truly elevate a narrative.

[No Country for Old Men (Coen Brothers, 2007)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/)
No Country For Old Men sparsely uses music, and instead relies heavily on sound design to build tension, specifically the use of diegetic sound—sound (in an television show, movie, etc.) that occurs within the context of the story and is able to be heard by the characters. It’s sounds like the hiss of Anton Chigurh's captive bolt pistol that show the effect Sound Editor Skip Lievasay wanted to achieve in this thriller. The absence of non-diegetic sound, or sound that serves only the audience and not the characters in the story, can offer a powerful narrative purpose.

[Dunkirk (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/)
Christopher Nolan's war epic Dunkirk uses sound to a nerve-wracking effect. From the ticking clock that underscores the entire score to the deafening roars of planes and explosions, the soundscape created by Richard King and Alex Gibson is relentless, anxiety-inducing, and incredibly effective at placing the audience right in the middle of the chaos.

[Baby Driver (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/)
Baby Driver stands out because it lets the music shine. The orchestration of music and movement in this movie had to be perfect—the story is about a badass getaway-car driver, after all—and the designers nail it. Between the song choices that really pump up the vibe of the movie and the high-octane chase scenes and action-packed visuals, there’s a dance happening between the movie’s two elements, always adding to the energy-packed feeling of the film.

[Gladiator (2000)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/)
In Gladiator, a visceral version of Roman history is portrayed on-camera, and the movie’s sound designers had a monumental task during its creation. The roar of the spectators echoing through the enormity of the Colosseum. The screams of a fighter on his final breath. The clashing of swords, axes, and shields. The sound design in Gladiator is instrumental in transporting its audience deep into the fierce realities of the Roman Colosseum. The audio landscape provides a visceral depth to this epic tale, anchoring viewers firmly within its action-filled universe.

[The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0440963/)
The Bourne Ultimatum, another Oscar-winning movie in the Sound Mixing category, expertly wields its sound design as a tool of immersion into the action-packed world of Jason Bourne. The mixing here allows the audience to really feel each punch and hear every tire screech, and while you might not notice that upon the first time watching the movie, you’ll certainly hear the difference it makes when you watch it next. The audio elevates the film's relentless pace, but also tunes viewers into its nuances, like the clanking of a keychain or footsteps from down the hall. Overall, it provides an exciting sonic journey alongside one of the world’s finest fictional spies.

[The Hurt Locker (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912/)
The Hurt Locker, a war thriller that follows a bomb-diffusion team through war-torn Afghanistan, is infused with boiling-point tension and incredible use of sound design. The experts behind the mixing board on this movie use sound to help characterize the scenery—military-style sounds play during scenes at the U.S. Army Base in contrast to notably “third world” sounds that play during scenes shot out in the city of Baghdad; when it’s time for one character to diffuse a bomb, the clicking and ticking sound as if they are happening right in your ear, bringing the audience one-step closer to the character’s experience. All in all, the sounds of The Hurt Locker are a pivotal aspect to the film and cannot go under-appreciated.

[Mad Max: Fury Road, George Miller, 2015](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/)
In Mad Max you can hear how sound editors, Mark Mangini and David White added so much richness and texture to the post apocalyptic world of _Mad Max: Fury Road_, for a well-deserved win. If the characters weren’t terrifying enough, their choices to add sound to nearly every action, added more layers of chaos and fear. Marked as one of the greatest “car chases” of all time, it’s hard to imagine that being true without the soundscape of Mangini and White.

[Hacksaw Ridge (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119532/)
Any war movie requires a particular attention to sound. Hacksaw Ridge, the story of the battle of Okinawa, displays one of the bloodiest battles in World War II with a remarkable commitment to auditory detail. Every single audio clip in this movie was meticulously crafted or replaced, a tactic that allows the sound designers to fine-tune the audience’s experience of the war drama. From the resounding explosions of the battle scenes to the hushed whispers of prayer, the completely customized sound design augments the gritty realism of this heavy-hitting real story.

[Arrival, Denis Villeneuve, 2016](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/)
Sylvain Bellemare wins the Sound Editing Oscar for much more than alien noises. The sound team hiked up a mountain in New Zealand for three days just to record native New Zealand birds. These sounds, tweaked at different pitches, gave us some of the best alien voices we’ve ever heard. Make sure to watch the full video.

[Whiplash (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582802/)
Whiplash is a testament to the power of jazz. As is expected, the film needed to make its audio more than a mere backdrop—rather, the score and sound design of this film are truly its heartbeat. The film opens with the sound of a drum roll, getting faster and faster, and it just builds in tone (and tempo) from there. Intense dialogue instills an aggressive tone to the film, which is matched beat-for-beat by the movie’s complex musical score. If you’re looking for a musically inspired movie that’ll leave your jaw on the floor, look no further.

[Spencer (2021)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12536294/)
Spencer comes with a surprise twist: The composer of the movie’s score is Johnny Greenwood, better known as the guitar player in the band Radiohead. Over the course of his career, he’s made a quiet name for himself as a movie score composer and, here, blends jazz and classic, Baroque styles to create an ominous overtone to the film. Greenwood uses sound design to portray the protagonist's internal struggle, employing subtlety to powerful effect. The echo of the empty palace, the rustle of turning pages, all contribute to a sense of isolation and unrest. Here, the audio is more than an accompaniment—it's a nuanced character in the story.

[Inception (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/)
What do dreams sound like? That's the question that Christopher Nolan and his sound design team set out to answer, and quite successfully. Inception is filled with sounds that are both real and surreal and help immerse the viewer in the bizarre dreamscape that its characters must escape from.

[Wall-E (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/)
How do you tell a story when your main characters can’t speak? In the case of Wall-E, quite masterfully. Every beep, squeak, and creak in Wall-E helps paint an emotional picture of a lonely little robot searching for some beauty in a world gone wrong, proving that when you have great sound, you don’t always need words.

[Braveheart (1995)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112573/)
Braveheart beautifully captures not only the serene landscape of the Scottish highlands, but the brutality of an oppressive regime and the war waged to be free from it. From the beautiful echoes of bagpipes to the rallying war cries of a scrappy army, Braveheart rings in your ears long after the final shot fades.

[Apollo 13 (1995)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/)
Similar to Gravity, Apollo 13 seeks to put the audience in the passenger seat of a daring space mission. Unlike Gravity, however, the sound design of Apollo 13 is less minimal but still impactful. It focuses heavily on the music of the era to tell the story of astronauts that are desperate to find a way back home.

[300 (2006)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/)
What makes the sound design in 300 so impressive is that nearly every sound element of this film had to be artificially created. Filmed almost entirely in a CGI-ready void, 300 does not benefit from natural environmental sounds that can be used in the final mix. Instead, sound designers inserted nearly every element of the final product, from the clanging of shields to the rustling of a breeze.

[West Side Story (2021)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581652/)
Like Fiddler on the Roof, West Side Story is a musical that used the leading sound capturing and designing technology of the time to create the crystal-clear soundtrack of this modern Romeo and Juliet masterpiece.

[Amadeus (1984)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/)
You simply cannot tell the story of one of the greatest composers of all time without a soundscape to match it. And Amadeus pulls out all the stops to have sound design worthy of the master himself, crafting a resonant soundtrack over a beautifully designed natural soundscape of 1800's Vienna.

[Repulsion (Roman Polanski, 1965)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059646/)
Polanski’s first English language film is a psychological horror starring Catherine Deneuve as a girl frightened by different mysterious elements in her apartment. As the film progresses, these fears become bigger and they take different physical form, but in the first half of the movie Polanski handles these fears by only suggesting them. The first of Deneuve’s fears are just noises outside the apartment. The horror is offscreen and that is how we get to the psychological root of the problem. The repulsion toward sexuality is expressed in a full horror frenzy of images, but sound prepares the ground before this climax.

[Blow Out (Brian De Palma, 1981)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082085/)
John Travolta plays a sound effects professional who records accidentally a murder, and no other film had involved the mechanics of sound work in cinema so deeply. The film starts with a cheap fake slasher interrupted by the sound crew because the scream of one of the girls doesn’t work.
It is a very funny scene and works as a gag in a way, but also shows how artificial the construction of sound in film can be. The scream, the knife, the steps of the characters, every element of this fake film are worked and recorded separately, using direct sound only as a reference.
Style and content are impossible to separate in “Blow Out”, and the interaction between sound and image is analyzed in every aspect, both in the film but also in the perception in real life. Very few films had more attention on sound as a concept.

[Come and See (Elem Klimov, 1985)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091251/) 
Probably the most interesting and atmospheric scene of this Soviet classic is the moment when Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko) hides behind a cow in the middle of a foggy night. But the key element of the unsettling feeling is given by the sound of those bullets. “Come and See” presents one the most special Foley use on bullets.
Instead of the typical shot sound that we are so used to, this are sniper bullets and you can hear how they are cutting through air. The fear is all around the scene, with total silence interrupted by these bullets. This must be the greatest example, but “Come and See” is full of this special way of using silence. The fear is all around, and like these bullets, there are explosions or screams interrupting this big silence.

[The Third Generation (Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1979)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079083/)
Whether we find the sound design experiment of “The Third Generation” successful, it is worthy to mention as one of the bravest and weirdest designs ever created. It was the first sound work by Hartmut Eichgrün, who would work later on Wim Wenders’ classic “Wings of Desire”, a film that applies some of the techniques seen in this film. Fassbinder always put a lot of importance on media and the way it constantly surrounds our background sound.
The ending of “The Marriage of Maria Braun” with loud radio transmissions is one of many examples. This idea was taken to an extreme level in this film. Following a terrorist group inspired by the RAF, every meeting is interrupted by radio or television noises.
The interesting thing is that they are on the same level of the conversations, making them difficult to follow. But this doesn’t happen in a couple of scenes; more than half of the scenes have this loud annoying background noise. In the film there two kinds of terrorism, the armed one and the informational one, and at the end it is the last one who wins.

[Only God Forgives (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1602613/)
The previous film by Winding Refn, “Drive”, quickly became a modern classic because of its hyper-stylized use of sound and vision. One of the main aspects that elevated the fame of the film was Cliff Martinez’s ambient soundtrack, and the use of Italo-disco songs by different artists. But the special thing about this score wasn’t only its quality, but the way it worked with the film.
Many of the film’s main scenes are constructed around the soundtrack; the music is used as a way of not only dramatizing a scene, but also directing the pace and style of the editing. This same element, again with Cliff Martinez as the main musician, is used and improved in “Only God Forgives”.
The slow movements of the characters are accompanied by this dark ambience, while the exploding violence is covered by a techno ambient beat. But it is not only the score that is one of the remarkable points of its sound design, as the film presents some of the most detailed Foley use. In the middle of this sacred silence, every step sounds loud enough to disturb the minds of the audience, and creates the hypnotic rhythm of the film.

[Berberian Sound Studio (Peter Strickland, 2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1833844/)
Since Fellini’s “8½”, cinema found different ways to reveal its mechanism. But sound and its construction is still kept a secret reserved for certain professionals, and that is the main reason why “Berberian Sound Studio” feels so fresh. The film settles in a sound studio in Italy for Giallo films. The Foley recording sessions show how a watermelon works as a bloody stabbing, or how somebody drowning can be replaced with lettuces in water.
The film remarks on the artificial quality of sound on film. We never see the scenes that the characters are working for, but even if we are seeing the watermelons, it still sounds like a gore fest. All these noises, especially in horror films, are inside our heads and they sound totally real in their fake way. The film evolves into a Lynchean nightmare scored by Broadcast, and it shows how unsettling and important the sound is for real terror.

[Caché (Michael Haneke, 2005)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387898/)
Haneke, like Fassbinder, has a special interest in our social relationship with media. “Caché” is defined commonly as a thriller, but some of the scenes play totally as a horror film. Haneke plays with the background sounds in different ways.
For example, in exterior shots everything sounds curiously low, especially in the quite static shots of the house. In interiors, this low volume plays on a bigger level, making every step or movement the only sound we can hear. The terrible suicide scene is almost hard to watch, and it is in part because of how empty the background sound is and how all we can hear is a knife cutting the neck.

[Barton Fink (Coen Brothers, 1991)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101410/)
Heavily influenced by Polanski’s apartment trilogy, the Coen Brothers took the idea of placing psychological sounds offscreen even further than in “Repulsion”. In the film, John Turturro plays a playwright moving to Hollywood to write films. In the middle of this cynical world, his apartment turns into a hell where his neighbor’s sounds make the task of writing an impossible one.
The sound design work of the film was obsessive, with composer Carter Burwell and sound designer Skip Lievsay experimenting with different ideas and methods for each scene. One of them consisted of pairing film sound and music in different frequencies.
If the exterior sounds were low vibrations and voices, then Burwell would add a high-pitched violin. If he used a counter bass, then Lievsay would make the wall sound sharp and annoying. The Coen Brothers’ screenplay allows these experiments, of course. The whole film is placed inside Barton’s head, and everything we hear is kind of real, but also distorted by his paranoia and fears.

[MASH (Robert Altman, 1970)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066026/)
Most of the directors and films on this list are recognized because of their conceptual ideas and for their way to work sound in the post-production phase. The case of Robert Altman is special for quite the opposite: Altman was the master of using and recording direct sound. Altman developed different techniques to record sounds and dialogues at the same time, and different ways to hide microphones from the camera.
In his large cast ensembles, you can hear everybody talk if they are inside the frame, sometimes overlapping between them and turning an effort to understand certain conversations. This realistic approach to sound turns into a very strange experience for the spectator who is not used to hearing different voices at the same time onscreen. “Mash” is just one example of this technique, but it also features different jokes related to sound.

[Blue Velvet (David Lynch, 1986)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090756/)
Like Robert Altman, David Lynch is a filmmaker who always gave special attention to sound design, and almost any of his films could make the list. Maybe his greatest work on sound was pairing with Alan Splet. The opening scene of “Blue Velvet” is a perfect example of the use of Foleys and sound distortion as an artistic expression.
The film opens with the ballad “Blue Velvet” and images of a perfect and clean neighborhood, until one of the neighbors suffer a stroke. The camera goes down into the grass in the garden and starts to dig deeper and deeper. The scene is disturbing by itself, but is only complete in combination with the distorted sound of grass and the disgusting effect of different insects’ sounds. The background sound plays a major role as well.
In Lynch’s films, it’s difficult to find a street that sounds like a normal street. Instead of that we have a constant low noise meant to keep us disturbed. This sound is everywhere in “Blue Velvet”.

[Tetsuo: The Iron Man (Shin'ya Tsukamoto, 1989)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096251/)
A businessman accidentally kills The Metal Fetishist, who gets his revenge by slowly turning the man into a grotesque hybrid of flesh and rusty metal. The sound design of the movie reflects the fantastic world of the movie via experimental sound design techniques utilizing metal scraps, electric motors and anthropocentric ingredients.

[Das Boot (Wolfgang Petersen, 1981)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096/)
War films are often recognized for their work on Foley design. Bullets, explosions and bombings are recorded under different ingenious techniques, because it is obviously cheaper and faster to record these elements with different tools inside a studio. The case of “Das Boot” required even more inventiveness considering all the sounds are underwater.
The mix in the film and frequency editing plays a major role in creating a submarine feeling. How would a crew experience weapons and war horror inside a submarine? All of this work is imagined in Petersen’s film with an impressive result.

[A Man Escaped (Robert Bresson, 1956)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049902/)
Robert Bresson may be one of the directors who theorized more about cinema and its techniques. One of his main subjects was sound as an expressive tool. He saw sounds as a parallel image, so when the sound was too powerful to replace the image, the attention then must be centered on that sound.
He believed that you can “neutralize” the image for those cases, making a descriptive frame with not a lot of interesting information. This can force the audience to pay attention to the sound and create a stronger image in their head.

[Rumble Fish (Francis Ford Coppola, 1983)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086216/)
There is always an important difference between sound design and a good use of soundtrack. A film with a straight and boring sound strategy could use a beautiful score, or vice versa. “Rumble Fish” is another great sound experiment by Coppola where this difference is harder to tell. Coppola wanted time and clocks to be key concepts for the film, so his plan was to produce an experimental score to achieve this. For his clock-rhythm experience, he decided to ask a professional drummer with no experience in film, Stewart Copeland from The Police.
Coppola and Copeland were willing to explore outside their fields, mixing sound design and musical composition as one. Clocks, pool balls and steps are used as music and are directly mixed with Copeland’s composition. Copeland himself recorded some of the street sounds used in “Rumble Fish” and mixed them together with his musical compositions. The film didn’t receive the success that Coppola expected, but in the last several years won a new status in great part because of this conception of sound.

[Stalker (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/)
Tarkovsky stated that in a perfect sound design, we mustn’t be able to recognize the difference between music and noises. “Stalker” was his most extreme case for this theory, making his composer create most of the sounds for the film, including some of the film noises performed on a synthesizer. He also wanted to mix Western and Eastern music for the score. Performing Western tunes on Oriental instruments and vice versa, Tarkovsky had the idea that both worlds could coexist, but might not be able to understand each other.
One of the iconic scenes with these ideas is the very first scene of the film where we see a couple in a room. In the director’s frozen shot style, we hear a lot of industrial noises without a clear precedence. The next scene shows a character in the middle of an industrial landscape and we hear the same sound, but with a more coherent image. All this playing creates an uncertain psychological atmosphere for the audience, and these kinds of experiments are all around in “Stalker”.

[Tabu (Miguel Gomes, 2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2153963/)
In the last few years, there has been a new interest from different directors to recreate or to take heavy influence from silent cinema. Some films like “The Artist” (Michel Hazanavicius, 2011) try to imitate silent cinema codes, while others like Miguel Gomes’ “Tabu” try to establish a fluid dialogue between those codes and our modern codes. The pluri-narrative of the film, the way the characters move, and the cinematography reflect this dialectic struggle.
But, like in most Gomes’ films, the sound is maybe the wildest and most experimental element. As we saw in “Blow Out” or “Berberian Sound Studio”, most of the sound in film is duplicated, created or dramatized at the sound studio. But what can happen when the reference is silent cinema? Gomes plays with this challenge through the entire film.
We see a fountain with water, but we don’t hear the water move; instead we can hear trees on the back of the screen. To hear the forest heavily inside a room and having a quiet one in a forest scene, all of these mixing devices are made to give a hint of the fiction of film sound.

[MAKING WAVES (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3856408/) The new documentary “Making Waves” explores the art of movie sound design. Here are 23 classic films, which were discussed in the documentary, that pushed the boundaries of movie sound.
