1. Select a video scene of at least 30 seconds to record a voice over track. The video can be a movie clip, documentary, or any other clip of your choice.  
  
2. Create a sound design for the scene effects and soundscape.  
  
3. Then record your voice over track. You can record anyone including yourself. Avoid reverb or background noise during your recording.  
  
4. Add your voice-over track to your project and adjust background music and effects using automation curves as I showed you in class.

Before importing your voiceover recording into Davinci Resolve, you can apply the following AI noise reduction tools.
