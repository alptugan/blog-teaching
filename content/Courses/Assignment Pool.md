## Week 1

Submit response papers (min. 300 words)

-   Read: “Delusions of Dialogue: Control and Choice in Interactive Art” (Delusions of Dialogue: Control and Choice in Interactive Art on JSTOR)

## Week 2

Instructions

// 1) 100 shapes; rect, circles, triangles, hexagons

// 2) 4 different colors

// 3) Randomly distribute 100s of shapes on Canvas

// 4) Set the opacity of each shape randomly between 0-255

// 5) Canvas size: 800 x 800 px

// 6) Use arrays in some part of your code

## Week 3

Use the following "Ball" class as a starting point.

Watch the videos on creating multiple objects using arrays and objects.

Instructions for assignment;

1- Create 200 instances of "Ball" object using for loops and arrays.

2- Set the circle size randomly for each instance of the Ball Object

3- Use 4 colors for the Ball instances.

4- Set the speedX and speedY randomly between -10 and +10

Read the following text and post an elaborate question.

Form_plus_code_01_pg-1_16.pdf

## Week 4

1.  Use the following code template to make you particles on the canvas clickable.

p5.js Web Editor | 2022_04_Object_Interaction_01_InClass ([p5js.org](http://p5js.org/))

1.  Whenever the user clicks the specific particle, make it disappear. You can apply several approaches to make it work like setting the size of the circles to zero, or you can remove the clicked item from the array.

Check the following tutorial (Daniel Schiffman)

Read the attached "Form_plus_code_02_pg-16_24.pdf" and submit your thoughts on relation between coding and art. No word limit.

## Week 5

Add a textfield to your p5JS sketch that shows the current score. Whenever the user clicks on a circle increase the score by one

## Week 6

Submit your game interface design and concept ideas. You don't need to upload the code. Just design files and text files.

You must include 3 different scenes and a word document that tells the game story respectively;

-   Word document: Write down the story and concept of your game idea elaborately.
-   Game Welcome Scene: Instructions and start game button will be in this scene.
-   Game Play Scene: Display the timer, enemy, hero, score, etc...
-   Game End Scene: Shows the final score, and other stuff that you want to include

## Week 7

1.  Set your design resolution to P5JS canvas resolution.
2.  Prepare your game design assets as png or jpg files.
3.  Use the game template (attached link in this LMS post) as reference to develop your game concept in P5JS.
4.  Submit your p5JS link

## Week 8

1.  Use the following code snippets to create a sound interactive game.
2.  Replace the rectangle in this code p5.js Web Editor | 2022_week09_SoundInteraction_NUI _02 ([p5js.org](http://p5js.org/)) with your own drawing or image.
3.  Replace the circles in this code p5.js Web Editor | 2022_04_Objects_Array_Left_to_Right_Particles ([p5js.org](http://p5js.org/)) with your own particle images.
4.  Check the video recording.

## Week 9

## Week 10

Your Final Project Proposals must include the following informations;

1.  **Descriptive Information (total: 80 points)**

Your name: …? (5 points) Course Name / Section: …? (5 points) Name of your project: …? (10 points) Description of your project: (include sketches, storyboard, pictures, photos, etc… in a nutshell, tell EXACTLY what you want to do) (60 points) The description part of your final project is the most important one. So, tell your idea clearly within relevant material. I included some topics and list down the required informations that you must include in your pdf file. You can use completely different idea. The point is how well you present your project.

-   If this is a game, there must be at least three scenes' visual design and game assets that are exported as png files;

1.  What is the story/concept? Goal of the game?
2.  How will be the game mechanics? E.g. User plays the game via mouse, keyboard, sound, motion detection using webcam, etc... Describe the UX elaborately.
3.  Assets of the game: Main character, enemies, background, fonts, color palette...
4.  welcome_scene (give instructions to the player on how to play the game)
5.  game_play_Scene (shows a screenshot image)
6.  game_over_Scene (Fail, Success, Score, any other thing that you imagine to show the player)
7.  Involve reference works.

-   If this is a generative art application, write down your main concept.

1.  What is your inspiration? Did you research about your idea? Review previously created works.
2.  Will it be interactive? If so, how will the user interact with your application. E.g. mouse, keyboard, sound, motion detection using webcam, etc... Describe the UX elaborately.
3.  Will it be animated? If so, explain it with example studies.
4.  Include your mood board.
5.  Include your color palette.
6.  Include your sketches and illustrations.
7.  Involve reference works.

-   If this is a data visualization app, explain the data you will use in your project.

1.  What is your inspiration? Did you research about your idea? Review previously created works.
2.  Will it be interactive? If so, how will the user interact with your application. E.g. mouse, keyboard, sound, motion detection using webcam, etc... Describe the UX elaborately.
3.  What type of data you gonna use? E.g. Weather, earthquake, the amount of happiness around university students, etc...
4.  Include your mood board.
5.  Include your color palette.
6.  Include your sketches and illustrations.
7.  Involve reference works.

-   If this is an interactive poster, explain what is it for?

1.  What is your main goal? Educational purposes (teaching kids about animals), entertainment (fortune game that tells irrelevant predictions), artistic, informative?
2.  How will the user interact with your application. E.g. mouse, keyboard, sound, motion detection using webcam, etc... Describe the UX elaborately.
3.  How many people can interact at the same time? Single user or multiple user?
4.  Include your color palette.
5.  Include your sketches and illustrations.

-   If this is an audio-reactive application / audiovisual, include following information?

1.  Is the application for a specific song or a general purpose sound visualizer that reacts to any sound?
    
2.  Involve at least three different visual style in three different scenes. (Let's suppose, you select three minute long song. For the time range between 0-59 seconds the visual style will be in tones of red color. Between 59-120 seconds the visuals transform into rectangular shapes. Between 120-180 seconds the visuals distribute around the canvas randomly...)
    
3.  Can the user modify parameters during the performance like a VJ? If so, define the possible user interaction methods.
    
4.  Include your color palette.
    
5.  Include your sketches and illustrations.
    
6.  Involve reference works.
    
7.  **Create a pdf file that includes the above sections. (10 points)**
    
8.  **Set the name your pdf file as** "yourName_Surname_Final_Project_Porposal_COD208_Your_Class_Section.pdf" (10 points) E.g. alptugan_Final_Project_Proposal_COD208_A.pdf
