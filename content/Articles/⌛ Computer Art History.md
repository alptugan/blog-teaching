+ 1940-1950s
+ Emergence of Computers in the History
+ The computer industry is relatively young in age when compared to most other industries. Measured from the date of the first computer installation in 1951, the industry is a little more than a decade old. The more significant date when discussing the industry's development would be the 1953-1954 period, when mass production techniques were applied to computer manufacture, and commercial electronic computers started to be produced on a large scale.

Bell Labs and RAND Corporation started work on how they can utilize computers to create artistic works.
