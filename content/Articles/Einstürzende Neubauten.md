The band has always experimented with sounds originally in noise music and recently in very diverse styles. Also EN uses ambient noises just like crowd at street or workers at factory to get listener into the music. Besides that, in my opinion mixing of the songs are sometimes considered to be  experimental. In such a way that band has been composing their music with unusual stuffs, so  traditional mixing techniques couldn't be sufficient. Because every single stuff which the band has been using, have different physical properties. In contrast to those stuffs like metal plates, traditional music instruments have fundamental physical properties. For instance, a sound engineer can make decision approximately possible EQ settings for an acoustic guitar, but a ready-found object which is never recorded before, has no fundamental properties. 

Sometimes listeners are facing with many different sonic atmospheres in a single song. It is because, mixing of the song and the sound effects that the band apply, are creating a very complex integrity. 

  

## Biography
The meaning of Einstürzende Neubaten is "buildings that are collapsing". The name derives from the qualitative description of earthquakes of magnitude IX given in the Richter Scale. And “Neubauten” is a general term referring to buildings which were constructed abruptly in Germany after 1945. Because of the World War II, there was an extensive destruction throughout Germany and then those cheaper and less aesthetically Neubautens were built rapidly. So Neubautens are very familiar elements of Germany.

Neubauten was founded by vocalist/guitarist Blixa Bargeld and percussionist and N.U. Unruh in Berlin. On April 1, 1980 Einstürzende Neubauten made their first performance. The band members were; Beate Bartel, Gudrun Gut, Blixa Bargeld and N.U. Unruh. Later Bartel and Gut left the band and then Alexander Von Borsig(alias Alexander Hacke) joined the band. He was a very talented kid. Also when he became a member of the Neubauten, he was only 15 years old.

In 1981, F.M. Einheit and Mark Chung joined the band as percussionist and their first LP (Kollaps) was released. By the time, they started to use self-made sound machines, various electronic sounds, treated cassettes loops and found objects(metal plates, tools, etc..)
  
In 1983, the band recorded their second album “Zeichnungen der Patienten”. In that year, also, Bargeld joined Neubauten.

In 1985, the next album was released which is called “Halber Menich”. Along with this album, the band’s musical structure has become more evident. Especially Bargeld’s lyrics and singing style was too effectual on that alteration.

In 1991, Einstürzende Neubauten recorded a soundtrack album for Heiner Müller’s play “Die Hamletmaschine (The Hamlet Machine). 

After the album called “Tabula Rasa” in 1993, Neubauten’s music became softer and they used electronic sounds much more than before. During the final mass duplication for the album, Martin Munih(mastering engineer) commented on the production as being one of their most insidious to date. After “Faustmusik” album Mark Chung and F.M. Einheit who contributed much to the music and sound of the band, left Einstürzende Neubauten.

In 1996, Bargeld and Hacke’s wife(singer Meret Becker) sang a duet on their new album “End Neu”. A world tour followed the release. During this time, Jochen Arbeit and Rudi Mose joined the band.

In 1997, they released remixes of “End Neu” in a new album. 

In 2000, from March 27 to May 23 Neubauten celebrated their 20th birthday and released “Silence is Sexy”.

In 2002, Einstürzende Neubauten began work on a new album. But this time they did not collaborate with a record company because they initiated a supporting system via Internet. About 2000 people joined that event. Thereupon an exclusive “Supporter Album #1” was sent out to them in autumn 2003. But then the band reneged on the idea of supporting system and cooperated with Mute Records.

In 2005, the band started a new project called Musterhaus. The first release “Anarchitektur” was sent out in May of 2005 and was also available for download to Musterhaus subscribers. In August 15th second Musterhaus album was finished. After this album also they ended up the Supporter Project. In December 8, Musterhaus’ 3rd album “Solo Bassfeder” released.

They released seven albums with Musterhaus Project. However the last one “Stimmen Resk” was more experimental than other Musterhaus albums. It contained new vocal experiments, voice manipulations, electronic pulses and metallic percussions.

## The Relation Between Luigi Russolo and Einstürzende Neubauten
“Luigi Russolo's 1913 work “The Art of Noises” is often cited as the first example of the industrial philosophy in modern music. After Russolo's “musica futurista” came Pierre Schaeffer and musique concrète, and this gave rise to early industrial music, which was made by manipulating cut sections of recording tape, and adding very early sound output from analog electronics devices.”   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music)

Russolo was a futurist painter, actually he wasn’t a musician. However he had a great deal enthusiasm about music, especially about noise. His aim was a musical revolution. Because, as he mentioned at his manifesto, after the industrial revolution our ears started to become familiar to the noise. Nevertheless formerly (before invention of machines) classical orchestras were expressing our sensations, but now they couldn’t express as well as before. 

Russolo’s opinion about “noise” starts with this paragraph, as he said; 
>“… Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to _noise-sound_.” 
>(Russolo 1913, The Art of Noise)

And he continues, 
>“This musical evolution is paralleled by the multiplication of machines. This limited circle of pure sounds must be broken, and the infinite variety of "noise-sound" conquered.” (Russolo 1913, The Art of Noise)

>“...we find far more enjoyment in combinating in thought the noises of trams, backfiring motors, carriages and bawling crowds than listening again to, for example, the "Eroica" or the "Pastoral".” (Russolo 1913, The Art of Noise)

>“We want to attune and regulate this tremendous variety of noises harmonically and rhythmically”. (Russolo 1913, The Art of Noise)

  When we listen to early albums of Einstürzende Neubauten, we can hear many kinds of those noisy sounds just like metal plates using as a percussion or ambient noises of industrial places. 

The most important suggestion of Russolo is “_Futurist orchestra_”. Former works of Neubauten was just like Russolo’s Futurist orchestra, as you listen to Neubauten, you realize that all of those noise families are included in  Neubauten’s music. The band uses noise materials as a supplementary source for their music just as Russolo suggested before.

It is obvious that Russolo’s opinion about the effect of noise was definitely true. As we see in Neubauten’s arrangements, in some cases, the sound of industrial metal tool percussion affects our senses much more than classical percussions. In addition to that, environmental components just like crowd of people, sounds of machines, mixture of different noise sources, etc. are exactly what Russolo wanted to do with the “Futurist Orchestra” family.

In conclusion, when we dissect Neubauten’s works, we can hear obviously all of the sounds which build the Noise Orchestra that Russolo mentioned in his manifesto. Russolo's former ideas such as attuned forms and regulated noises, ready-found objects,  untraditional music equipments are fitted perfectly to Neubauten's music.  

  

## Analysis of the Song Called “Silence is Sexy”
This song is from “Silence is Sexy” album in 2000. In total, it is 7 minutes length, and starts with a lighter sound which Bargeld lights his  cigarette. When you start to listen to “Silence is Sexy”, you'll realize step by step, actually there is no silence at all. At some parts of the song, Bargeld stops singing, and you noticed, sometimes the sound of the cigarette that appears in the song randomly. 

The song can be considered to be consist of four separate parts. First part of the song contains only bass guitar and vocal parts. In addition, we hear some percussion stuffs and random sounds of cigarette. At the end of first part, there is a bridge, about a minute, to the second part, and  we hear only the sound of cigarette with silence. Along with end of silent part, song enhances with cymbals and drums. However, as we noticed from acoustical sensation, mix of the drums are not edited in traditional way. It's heard, as it wasn't recorded in a recording studio. You can realize this state especially from ambiance sound, acoustical sensations. 

After the second and the third part, the song enters silent part with sound of cigarette again. Besides that, in the third part lyrics are changed in to German. In my opinion there's a key point in lyrics about song at this German section. Bargeld uses “tinitus” word which means “tinnitus” in English. Tinnitus is “the perception of sound in the human ear in the absence of corresponding external sound(s).” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus). This is a kind of illness which is very common among the musicians. Even if there's no sound -as this is impossible- Bargeld hears his own sound which is looping in his ears, and this state comes to be true in the last part. Along with last part, we start to hear a tinnutus noise(sound). Moreover, Bargeld surprizes us in the last part with lyrics and additional chorus part. In this section, chorus part “Silence is Sexy” is changed into “just your silence is not sexy at all”, and then Bargeld sings last chorus, “Silence is Sexy”, with audiences (This chorus part is an earlier concert record of Neubauten's audiences). 

There's not so much noisy components in this song if we compare it with earlier compositions of Neubauten. However, in some cases, they use traditional musical instruments, like kick, as an ambient effect. Kick tone is felt like the sound of a closing door towards the end of the song.
