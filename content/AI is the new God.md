People miss the point that many of the AI tools (paid ones especially) are the products. Companies must sell their products, so they can continue to develop more products and gain capital. ChatETC… tools are good for generating ideas, they can inspire us, they can instantly collect and synthesize information faster than us. But the point is speed doesn’t mean that accuracy. AI system still producing false information. So the question is what you are looking for. 
All of the ontology created upon the center of humanity. Triple O can supply answer for us for today. Harman says that there are sensual objects independent from humans. For example, pleasure is a sensual object. We cannot know the pleasure that your pet feels. Because humanity created the construct to describe the concept of pleasure. For example a baby doesn’t aware of the constructed concept of pleasure. But we can identify it according to their mimics and gestures we can say that a baby is happy or sad. A newborn cannot capable of the meaning of pleasure or the concept. But they can use that sensual object. So we can epistemologically determine that object according to 1000s year of experience and say that if a baby is happy or not. 

In order to use the AI tools efficiently you must know have the factual knowledge and conceptual knowledge first;

However people miss that part and try to get answer by asking questions in general level. Most of the time the system works as trial and error to find the answer. The worse part is AI systems have advantages in terms of applying Procedural Knowledge because all of them have that. They have the factual, conceptual and procedural knowledge. 

Anderson and Krathwohl propose an additional knowledge level called “Metacognitive Knowledge” which is missing in all of the AI systems as long as the system is not scripted in that way of information. The problem is AI system doesn’t know what they don’t know in the cognitive level. 

The other big problem is most of the time we are demanding for knowledge from AI systems by accepting they have the metacognitive level of information. How can you get benefit from systems like Copilot or Tabby, if you don’t have the knowledge about factual or conceptual knowledge. If you don’t know anything about programming paradigms or concepts, it is impossible to ask relevant question. For example if you don’t know what is called array, why you need it how can you ask the question (Figure 2). Using natural language may help you in terms of making easy to resolve some tasks, but what if the result is wrong?

In order to know the array, you need to the concept of variables. According to the programming language, there can be type declarations. Another question what is types of data. And many more concepts you need to know during the programming. The worst part is lets say by chance you have a running program…

TLDR; We must know have the knowledge in order to accurately benefit from the AI systems. Otherwise it becomes something like a lottery. The concept of knowing things becomes the concept of beliefs. As it is declared on Megadeth’s lyrics; In every be(lie)f there is lie…

In the history of time, the capitalist system tries to create a consumer society by black-boxing the technologies. All time of the events, actors of specific social groups break the box and open it to make it accessible to social groups. In the early days of computers, only professionals could code the computers. Within the tech advances and high level programming languages, programming gets wide spread. But we were capable of limited actions using computers until the Arduino is invented, later Raspberry Pi and we can start to get benefit form computers again. Today the same thing is happening in terms of programming. Because if you leave programming to companies, companies can govern you. The NVIDIA conference is a proof of that. The CEO says “leave computer programming to us”. Why? It is for me declaring “leave reading a book for us, we can summarize for you”
