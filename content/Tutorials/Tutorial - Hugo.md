## Summary
This tutorial covers how to build basic Hugo static site and publish specific pages in your current Obsidian Vault.

Quartz is a great tool for showing your digital garden of thoughts and your mind. But sometimes, I need to instantly share something from my private vault to the audience or colleagues online. Plus, it is a practice for me to dive into Hugo framework. Since Quartz 4 is built upon Hugo, it would be good to have some more technical knowledge about what is going on behind the scenes. 

The main take aways are as follows;
- [ ] Create and share notes online from Obsidian.
- [ ] Host the website free on Github.
- [ ] Learn something new.

1. I am planning to use the following plugin with Obsidian `obsidian://show-plugin?id=hugo-preview-obsidian`
2. Install Hugo using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager for Mac →  [link](https://gohugo.io/installation/macos/#homebrew)
3. Follow the tutorial → [link](https://quantick.dev/posts/obsidian-hugo/)
