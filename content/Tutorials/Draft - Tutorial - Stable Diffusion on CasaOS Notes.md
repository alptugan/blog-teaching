# Download Models
For downloading a specific model you can search for it. But mostly Hugging Face repository is a good and safer place to start with.

## Failed Try
Because my GPU has 6 GB memory, and the model size exceeds 6GB so it cannor be loaded. Navigate to [stabilityai/sdxl-trubo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo)
