In terms of interface flowershow seems a better alternative for publishing specific content from my original Obsidian Vault.

[[Tutorial - Quartz 4 for Obsidian Publish]] seems doing the job. But it does have some issues in terms of UI preferences. I spent two days to fix "Explorer" component issue. Whenever the user pages size decreases the sidebars disappear which is not convenient for mobile and tablet users. The responsive part is needs to be fixed.
